Business Scenario

Assume that each team is a company. The customers ask companies to write five sorting algorithms, including Bubble Sort, Selection Sort, Insertion Sort, Merge Sort, Quick Sort. These codes are written in five programming languages, Java, Python, Julia, Go, Rust programming languages 

Each algorithm is its programming branches. For example, insertion sort algorithm has its Java version, Python version, Julia version, Go version, and Rust version; Quick sort algorithm has its Java version, Python version, etc.

Each programming language has its algorithm branches. For example, java branch has Bubble Sort, Selection Sort, Insertion Sort, etc.

Job Roles

Each company has three job roles, including developers, quality assurances, and product managers. Developers write codes, then commit to the GitHub. Quality Assurance review codes with comments. then merge branches. Product managers pull all codes then compile these from the GitHub.
